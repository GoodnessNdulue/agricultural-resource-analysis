# Agricultural Resource Management Dashboard

![Dashboard Preview](dashboard/farm_dashboard_screenshot.png)

## 📌 Project Overview

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing **1,350 tons of farm yield**, tracking water usage (2.84M cubic meters), fertilizer (245.27 units), and pesticide consumption (119.90 units) across **9 crop types** and **5 soil types**.

**Goal:** Optimize agricultural resource allocation, identify water usage patterns, and provide actionable insights for sustainable farming practices.

## 📊 Key Metrics Tracked

- **Total Yield:** 1.35K tons
- **Water Usage:** 2.84M cubic meters
- **Fertilizer Used:** 245.27 units
- **Pesticide Used:** 119.90 units
- **Crops Analyzed:** 9 varieties (Tomato, Barley, Cotton, Carrot, Soybean, Sugarcane, Rice, Potato, Wheat, Maize)
- **Soil Types:** 5 types (Clay, Loamy, Sandy, Silty, Peaty)
- **Seasons Tracked:** 3 growing seasons (Zaid, Kharif, Rabi)

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 1. Water Usage by Crop Type
- **Tomato crops** require the highest water consumption at **0.44M cubic meters**
- This is **3x more** than maize (0.13M cubic meters)
- **Recommendation:** Optimize irrigation systems for high-water crops or consider drought-resistant varieties

### 2. Water Usage by Soil Type
- **Clay soil** shows the highest water consumption at **0.76M cubic meters**
- **Peaty soil** uses the least at **0.20M cubic meters** (73% less than clay)
- **Critical finding:** Clay soil's high water retention may indicate over-irrigation or inefficient drainage

### 3. Seasonal Water Usage Patterns
- **Zaid season** (summer) peaks at **1.18M cubic meters** of water usage
- **Kharif season** (monsoon) uses **1.05M cubic meters**
- **Rabi season** (winter) shows lowest usage at **0.61M cubic meters**
- **Insight:** Summer crops require nearly 2x more water than winter crops

### 4. Resource Efficiency Opportunities
- **Cotton, Carrot, and Soybean** show moderate water usage (0.29-0.37M) with balanced resource consumption
- **Wheat and Maize** are the most water-efficient crops relative to yield
- **Opportunity:** Increase acreage of water-efficient crops in water-scarce regions

## 💡 Recommendations Delivered

### 1. **Optimize Irrigation for High-Water Crops**
- Implement drip irrigation for tomato crops to reduce water waste
- Target 15-20% water reduction while maintaining yield
- Estimated annual water savings: **66K-88K cubic meters**

### 2. **Soil Management Strategy**
- Improve drainage systems in clay soil areas to prevent over-saturation
- Consider soil amendments to improve water retention efficiency
- Test peaty soil practices as a model for water conservation

### 3. **Seasonal Crop Planning**
- Shift water-intensive crops away from Zaid (summer) season when possible
- Increase winter crop (Rabi) acreage to balance annual water consumption
- Strategic crop rotation to optimize seasonal resource usage

### 4. **Resource Allocation Dashboard**
- Implement real-time monitoring of water, fertilizer, and pesticide usage
- Set alerts when consumption exceeds optimal thresholds per crop type
- Track resource efficiency metrics monthly to identify trends
